# Understand ruby memory usage ðŸ¤”

I initially made this blog post to add questions I have about ruby memory. I don't have any CS degree, never did some C, understanding how ruby memory use is not an easy path. I'm passionate about this subject.

## Questions

Here is a list of questions I have. Feel free to make a PR to answer them.

* Retained Vs Allocated: Does an object that is allocated can turn to be retained because he is still present after few GC ?

* Why when using a frozen string we don't allocate memory ?
I use a method because it represents "patterns" we discuss with my team, I try to measure the number of allocations betweens calling directly string, calling a string set into a constant outside the function and calling a string frozen in a constant outside the function.

  ```ruby
  require 'memory_profiler'

  report_1 = MemoryProfiler.report do
    def get_me_directly
      "hey"
    end
    get_me_directly
  end

  report_2 = MemoryProfiler.report do
    ST = "yep"
    def get_me_with_constant
      ST
    end
    get_me_with_constant
  end

  report_3 = MemoryProfiler.report do
    ST_FREEZE = "yop".freeze
    def get_me_with_constant_freeze
      ST_FREEZE
    end
    get_me_with_constant_freeze
  end

  report_1.pretty_print
  # Allocated String Report
  # -----------------------------------
  #          1  "hey"
  #          1  measure_allocation.rb:5
  #
  #
  # Retained String Report
  # -----------------------------------

  report_2.pretty_print
  # Allocated String Report
  # -----------------------------------
  #          1  "yep"
  #          1  measure_allocation.rb:11
  #
  #
  # Retained String Report
  # -----------------------------------
  #          1  "yep"
  #          1  measure_allocation.rb:11

  report_3.pretty_print
  # Allocated String Report
  # -----------------------------------
  #
  # Retained String Report
  # -----------------------------------
  ```

* What are the first line of heap dump that are not address ?
(Add exemple)

> Manually inspecting this file might be of some interest, but we really need to aggregate information to make use of this data. Before we do that, letâ€™s look at some of the keys in the generated JSON.
> * generation: The garbage collection generation where the object was generated
> * file: The file where the object was generated
> * line: The line number where the object was generated
> * address: This is the memory address of the object
> * memsize: The amount of memory the object consumes
> * references: The memory addresses of other objects that this object retains
> There are other keys, but thatâ€™s enough for now. Itâ€™s worth noting that several of these are optional. For example if an object was generated before you started tracing object allocations, it wonâ€™t contain generation, file, or line information.

* What is allocated and what is not allocated ?
  * strings    : yes
  * symbols    : ?
  * integer    : ?
  * boolean    : not
  * constant   : ?
  * freeze obj : ?

* What is garbage collected ?
  * strings    : yes
  * symbols    : ?
  * integer    : ?
  * boolean    : not
  * constant   : ?
  * freeze obj : ?

* Why people are always scared about time spent in GC when the Newrelic graph of our app show an average time spent in GC that is 0.0676% ?
