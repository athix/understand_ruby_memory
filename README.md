# Understand ruby memory usage ðŸ¤”

I initially made this blog post to add questions I have about ruby memory. I don't have any CS degree, never did some C, understanding how ruby memory use is not an easy path. I'm passionate about this subject.

## Questions

Here is a list of questions I have. Feel free to make a PR to answer them.

* Retained Vs Allocated: Does an object that is allocated can turn to be retained because he is still present after few GC ?

* What are the first line of heap dump that are not address ?
(Add exemple)
Partially answered from https://blog.codeship.com/the-definitive-guide-to-ruby-heap-dumps-part-i/

* Why when using a frozen string we don't allocate memory ?
I use a method because it represents "patterns" we discuss with my team, I try to measure the number of allocations betweens calling directly string, calling a string set into a constant outside the function and calling a string frozen in a constant outside the function.

```ruby
require 'memory_profiler'

report_1 = MemoryProfiler.report do
  def get_me_directly
    "hey"
  end
  get_me_directly
end

report_2 = MemoryProfiler.report do
  ST = "yep"
  def get_me_with_constant
    ST
  end
  get_me_with_constant
end

report_3 = MemoryProfiler.report do
  ST_FREEZE = "yop".freeze
  def get_me_with_constant_freeze
    ST_FREEZE
  end
  get_me_with_constant_freeze
end

report_1.pretty_print
# Allocated String Report
# -----------------------------------
#          1  "hey"
#          1  measure_allocation.rb:5
#
#
# Retained String Report
# -----------------------------------

report_2.pretty_print
# Allocated String Report
# -----------------------------------
#          1  "yep"
#          1  measure_allocation.rb:11
#
#
# Retained String Report
# -----------------------------------
#          1  "yep"
#          1  measure_allocation.rb:11

report_3.pretty_print
# Allocated String Report
# -----------------------------------
#
# Retained String Report
# -----------------------------------
```

> Manually inspecting this file might be of some interest, but we really need to aggregate information to make use of this data. Before we do that, letâ€™s look at some of the keys in the generated JSON.
> * generation: The garbage collection generation where the object was generated
> * file: The file where the object was generated
> * line: The line number where the object was generated
> * address: This is the memory address of the object
> * memsize: The amount of memory the object consumes
> * references: The memory addresses of other objects that this object retains
> There are other keys, but thatâ€™s enough for now. Itâ€™s worth noting that several of these are optional. For example if an object was generated before you started tracing object allocations, it wonâ€™t contain generation, file, or line information.

* What is allocated and what is not allocated ?
  * strings    : yes
  * symbols    : ?
  * integer    : ?
  * boolean    : not
  * constant   : ?
  * freeze obj : ?

* What is garbage collected ?
  * strings    : yes
  * symbols    : ?
  * integer    : ?
  * boolean    : not
  * constant   : ?
  * freeze obj : ?
